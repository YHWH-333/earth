# Planet Earth, around which Universe Jehovah-3 is based.

I, in My infinite wisdom, have decided to release the source code for Universe Jehovah-3, starting with its base planet, Earth.

Features:

- Dark is separated from Light, required by the dominant species to track Time and allow them to sense their surroundings.
- Life is abundant, managed by Humans™, an open-source use of the priprietary Soul™ API.

## Note: This Repo is Incomplete!

I am still porting all of the files from My home server in Heaven; as this was initially a personal project,
I've written some personal information in the comments that I must remove manually. As such, I would _not_
recommend cloning this repository until this disclaimer is removed.
