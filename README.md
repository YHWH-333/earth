I, in My infinite wisdom, have decided to release the source code for Universe Jehovah-3, starting with its base planet, Earth.

## Features

- Dark is separated from Light, required by the dominant species to track Time and allow them to sense their surroundings.
- Life is abundant, managed by Humans, the most in-depth use of the Soul API to date!
- Evolution algorithm automatically selects the most suitable beings for life on the Earth.
- Built in Scala, the _true_ language of the Gods.
    - Yes, I am confirming that Martin Odersky is a prophet.

**Please check out the closed issues before submitting a new one!**

## **Note: This Repo is Incomplete!**

_I am still porting all of the files from My company server in Heaven; as this was initially a proprietary project,
I've written some personal/business information in the comments that I must remove manually. As such, I would **not**
recommend cloning this repository until this disclaimer is removed._
