I, in My infinite wisdom, have decided to release the source code for Universe Jehovah-3, starting with its base planet, Earth.

## Features

- Dark is separated from Light, required by the dominant species to track Time and allow them to sense their surroundings.
- Life is abundant, managed by Humans™, a use of the proprietary Soul™ API.
- Evolution algorithm automatically selects the most suitable beings for life on the Earth.
